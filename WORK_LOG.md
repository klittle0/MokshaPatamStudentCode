| Sep 1 | 7-7:30pm  |                                                                                                                                    I considered how to use a recursive/DFS approach to find all possible # of moves |
| Sep 2 | 3:00-3:30 |                                                       I decided my previous approach would be inefficient, so I pivoted to checking for the longest ladder & building my approach that way. I wrote new pseudocode. |
| Sep 2 | 3:30-4:30 |                                                        I realized my new idea would not account for all possibilities, so I switched back to a recursive approach. I drafted a quicksort method & wrote pseudocode. |
| Sep 4 | 2:30-3:00 | After class, I realized that a quicksort method wouldn't help the efficiency of my recursive approach in any way, but I realized that I was on the right track to think about recursion. I implemented a BFS search |
| Sep 5 | 2:30-3:00 |                                               After Mr. Blick's presentation, I realized that BFS without recursion would be better for this problem set. I altered my old algorithm so that there wasn't recursion |
