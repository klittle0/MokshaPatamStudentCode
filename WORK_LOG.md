| Sep 1 | 7-7:30pm  |                                                                              I considered how to use a recursive/DFS approach to find all possible # of moves |
| Sep 2 | 3:00-3:30 | I decided my previous approach would be inefficient, so I pivoted to checking for the longest ladder & building my approach that way. I wrote new pseudocode. |
| Sep 2 | 3:30-4:30 |  I realized my new idea would not account for all possibilities, so I switched back to a recursive approach. I drafted a quicksort method & wrote pseudocode. |
